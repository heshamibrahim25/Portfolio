    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a DevOps and Cloud Engineer with expertise in designing, automating, and optimizing 
      cloud-based infrastructures across platforms like Azure, AWS, and Huawei Cloud. I specialize 
      in CI/CD pipelines, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible), 
      and cloud-native solutions that enhance scalability, security, and operational efficiency. 
      My focus is on bridging development and operations to deliver faster, more reliable, and cost-effective deployments.
    </p>
    <p>
      I’ve always seen my career as more than just a collection of roles or certifications. 
      It’s been a journey of growth, resilience, and a constant push to raise my own standards. 
      From the beginning, I was driven by curiosity and a genuine desire to understand how technology connects people 
      and makes businesses stronger. That curiosity shaped the way I approached every step of my path, not only as a learner 
      but as someone who wanted to create real impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along the way, I discovered that growth doesn’t come from comfort—it comes from challenges. 
      Each new certification, each skill I studied, wasn’t just about passing an exam; 
      it was about proving to myself that I could step into bigger shoes and handle greater responsibility. 
      I’ve learned to be adaptable, to lead when leadership is needed, and to listen when collaboration matters most.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, as a Senior Cloud Engineer, I see my role as part technical expertise, part problem-solver, and part mentor. 
      What drives me is the opportunity to take complex challenges and turn them into solutions that bring value to teams and organizations. 
      Just as importantly, I take pride in helping others around me grow, because I know firsthand how guidance and encouragement 
      can transform someone’s career path.
    </p>
    <p>
      My story is still being written, but if there’s one constant, it’s this: 
      I’m committed to learning, evolving, and contributing—not just to technology, 
      but to the people and organizations that depend on it.
